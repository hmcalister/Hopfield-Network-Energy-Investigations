# Hopfield Network Go
#### Author: Hayden McAlister

## Introduction

This project was an initial investigation into implementing the Hopfield network (and some other supporting methods) in Go. When the project reached the current state, it was determined that Go is slightly too lenient for this task, and the project was [ported to Rust](https://github.com/hmcalister/Hopfield-Network-Rust) before too much time had been put into it. Feel free to fork this repository if it is useful to you - there is no real reason to avoid Go for this type of project, simply personal preference for a slightly stricter implementation!
